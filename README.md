#### Software dependencies
The software used to create Figure 1 is open source:

R version 3.2.2: [http://www.r-project.org/](http://www.r-project.org/)

----------------------
#### Data

Journals were identified through a search of the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) using the following search terms: "Ecology" for category, "2013" for year, "SCIE" (Science Citation Index) and "SSCI" (Social Sciences Citation Index) editions checked, and "Web of Science" for the category schema.  Between March 1, 2015 and June 1, 2015, the author instructions for each journal were searched to determine if there was any mention of code or software in the context of scientific research.  We also determined whether journals had a section for documentation of scientific software releases, and if journals had a policy requiring the release of code and/or data for article publication.

#### Graph
Figure 1 was made using R. To recreate the graph in Figure 1, paste the following commands into a unix shell.  The commands assume that the current directory is the CodeEcologyJournals folder.  The graph will be saved in the Graphs folder.

Change directory:  

    cd RCode

Command to plot graph:

    RScript AnalyzeJournalInfo.R
